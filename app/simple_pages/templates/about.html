    <p>
        Welcome to the is601 project 4 for Colton Johnson. This project allows a user to go through the authentication
        process of registering and logging into the website. It also allows a use to upload a csv file of Transactions that
        will then populate the dashboard with these transactions as well as show your current balance.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        In order to access the
        functionality of this project a user needs to register through the authentication system
        of this web app. It will then redirect a user to the login page where they can log in.
        If you already have an account you can quickly log in through this page.
